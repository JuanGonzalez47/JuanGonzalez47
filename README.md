### üöÄ Featured Projects

This is a selection of projects that showcase my learning journey across different areas of data science and engineering.

| Project | Brief Description | What I Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üí≥ **Credit Risk Analysis** | An end-to-end data science project to predict loan default, covering data cleaning, EDA, and modeling. | How to execute a data science project from start to finish, from defining the business problem to evaluating the model. I applied the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** to manage and transform data in a structured and scalable way. |
| üéôÔ∏è **Speaker Verification with MFCC** | An ML system that applies **MFCC** for audio feature extraction and speaker classification. | How to transform unstructured data (audio) into meaningful numerical features using signal processing techniques like **MFCC**. This was key to building and evaluating an effective classification model. |
| ü§ñ **AGROBOT (Innovation with Design Thinking)** | Applying the **Design Thinking** methodology to define, prototype, and validate a robotic solution for agriculture. | The importance of methodologies like **Design Thinking** to deeply understand a business problem and user needs **before** writing a single line of code. I learned to define a data strategy that truly addresses validated problems. |
| üéõÔ∏è **ARM Processor on FPGA** | Designing and implementing an **ARMv7** processor in SystemVerilog on an FPGA for real-time data acquisition and control. | The fundamental connection between high-level software and the hardware it runs on. Designing a processor from scratch taught me how each instruction translates into physical operations, reinforcing my ability to write efficient and optimized code. |

### üî¨ Research and Affiliations

I am an active and committed member of two research groups at the **University of Antioquia**, where I apply and expand my knowledge in practical and challenging contexts:

*   **GITA (Applied Telecommunications Research Group):** I apply **image processing and data analysis techniques** to optimize the manufacturing of optoelectronic devices. My work involves analyzing images of **heterostructures** to extract critical information about their quality and developing scripts to **automate this validation process**, improving efficiency and reproducibility.
*   **GEPAR (Power Electronics, Automation, and Robotics Group):** My focus is on the **intelligent automation of processes** in the agro-industrial sector. This includes designing systems for **real-time data monitoring and collection using IoT sensors**, and then using that data to develop **robotics and control solutions** that optimize efficiency and solve operational problems.

### üé® Beyond the Code: Data Storytelling & Communication

I firmly believe that the true impact of an analysis lies in its ability to be communicated clearly and convincingly. My background in **Digital Marketing (Certified)** is not just an additional skill, but an integral part of how I approach data problems:

*   **Translating Data into Visual Stories:** Instead of just showing tables and numbers, I use my design experience (with tools like Adobe Illustrator and Canva) to create **data visualizations, infographics, and dashboards** that are intuitive and effectively communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

*   **Focus on User Experience and Business Metrics:** My training in marketing has given me a solid foundation in **analyzing user behavior (UX) and defining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**. This allows me not only to build an accurate model but also to understand how to measure its success and align it with business goals.

*   **Delivering High-Impact Project Presentations:** I leverage my skills in audiovisual production (Adobe Premiere) to create **project demonstrations and executive summaries** that explain the value and functionality of my solutions in a dynamic and digestible way.

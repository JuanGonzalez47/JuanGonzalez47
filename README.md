### 🚀 Featured Projects

This is a selection of projects that showcase my ability to build and deploy end-to-end data and AI solutions.

| Project | Brief Description | What I Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 💬 **Cloud-Native WhatsApp Chatbot** | A full-stack chatbot with multiple conversation flows, deployed on **AWS**. Features a RabbitMQ message queue, PostgreSQL DB, and a FastAPI backend. | How to architect and deploy a complete MLOps solution. I learned to integrate decoupled services in the cloud (**RDS, Amazon MQ, App Runner**) and manage a production-ready system from local development to a live API. |
| 🏭 **YamaLens: CV for Manufacturing** | A real-time computer vision system to detect, classify, and count motorcycle parts on a production line, automating a previously manual process. | How to apply computer vision to solve a tangible business problem.

### 🔬 Research and Affiliations

I am an active and committed member of two research groups at the **University of Antioquia**, where I apply and expand my knowledge in practical and challenging contexts:

*   **GITA (Applied Telecommunications Research Group):** I apply **image processing and data analysis techniques** to optimize the manufacturing of optoelectronic devices. My work involves analyzing images of **heterostructures** to extract critical information about their quality and developing scripts to **automate this validation process**, improving efficiency and reproducibility.
*   **GEPAR (Power Electronics, Automation, and Robotics Group):** My focus is on the **intelligent automation of processes** in the agro-industrial sector. This includes designing systems for **real-time data monitoring and collection using IoT sensors**, and then using that data to develop **robotics and control solutions** that optimize efficiency and solve operational problems.

### 🎨 Beyond the Code: Data Storytelling & Communication

I firmly believe that the true impact of an analysis lies in its ability to be communicated clearly and convincingly. My background in **Digital Marketing (Certified)** is not just an additional skill, but an integral part of how I approach data problems:

*   **Translating Data into Visual Stories:** Instead of just showing tables and numbers, I use my design experience to create **data visualizations, infographics, and dashboards** that are intuitive and effectively communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
*   **Focus on User Experience and Business Metrics:** My training in marketing has given me a solid foundation in **analyzing user behavior (UX) and defining KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**. This allows me not only to build an accurate model but also to understand how to measure its success and align it with business goals.
